# git-auto-commit Action

> The GitHub Action for committing files for the 80% use case.

This GitHub Action automatically commits files which have been changed during a Workflow run and pushes the commit back to GitHub.  
The default committer is "GitHub Actions <actions@github.com>", and the default author of the commit is "Your GitHub Username <github_username@users.noreply.github.com>".

This Action has been inspired and adapted from the [auto-commit](https://github.com/cds-snc/github-actions/tree/master/auto-commit
)-Action of the Canadian Digital Service and this [commit](https://github.com/elstudio/actions-js-build/blob/41d604d6e73d632e22eac40df8cc69b5added04b/commit/entrypoint.sh)-Action by Eric Johnson.

## Usage

Add the following step at the end of your job, after other steps that might add or change files.

```yaml
- uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4.2.0
  with:
    # Required
    commit_message: Apply automatic changes

    # Optional branch to push to, defaults to the current branch
    branch: feature-123

    # Optional git commit params
    commit_options: '--no-verify --signoff'

    #Â Optional glob pattern of files which should be added to the commit
    file_pattern: src/*.js tests/*.js

    # Optional git add params
    add_options: '--force'

    # Optional local file path to the repository
    repository: .

    # Optional commit user and author settings
    commit_user_name: My GitHub Actions Bot
    commit_user_email: my-github-actions-bot@example.org
    commit_author: Author <actions@github.com>

    # Optional tag message
    # Action will create and push a new tag to the remote repository and the defined branch
    tagging_message: 'v1.0.0'
```

## Example

In this example, we're running `php-cs-fixer` in a PHP project to fix the codestyle automatically, then commit possible changed files back to the repository.

Note that we explicitly specify `${{ github.head_ref }}` in the checkout Action.
This is required in order to work with the `pull_request` event (or any other non-`push` event).

```yaml
name: php-cs-fixer

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - "master"

jobs:
  php-cs-fixer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}

    - name: Run php-cs-fixer
      uses: docker://oskarstark/php-cs-fixer-ga

    - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4.2.0
      with:
        commit_message: Apply php-cs-fixer changes
```

## Limitations & Gotchas

### Checkout the correct branch

You must use `action/checkout@v2` or later versions to checkout the repository.
In non-`push` events, such as `pull_request`, make sure to specify the `ref` to checkout:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
```

You have to do this do avoid that the `checkout`-Action clones your repository in a detached state.

### Commits of this Action do not trigger new Workflow runs

The resulting commit **will not trigger** another GitHub Actions Workflow run.
This is due to [limititations set by GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token).

> When you use the repository's GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks on behalf of the GitHub Actions app, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs.

You can change this by creating a new [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new),
storing the token as a secret in your repository and then passing the new token to the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage) Action.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
```

### Unable to commit into PRs from forks

GitHub currently prohibits Actions to push commits to forks, even when they created a PR and allow edits.
See [issue #25](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/issues/25) for more information.

## Inputs

Checkout [`action.yml`](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action/blob/master/action.yml) for a full list of supported inputs.

## Outputs

You can use these outputs to trigger other Actions in your Workflow run based on the result of `git-auto-commit-action`.

- `changes_detected`: Returns either "true" or "false" if the repository was dirty and files have changed.

## Troubleshooting

### Action does not push commit to repository

Make sure to [checkout the correct branch](#checkout-the-correct-branch).

### Action does not push commit to repository: Authentication Issue

If your Workflow can't push the commit to the repository because of authentication issues,
please update your Workflow configuration and usage of [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage).

Updating the `token` value with a Personal Access Token should fix your issues.

### No new workflows are triggered by the commit of this action

This is due to limitations set up by GitHub, [commits of this Action do not trigger new Workflow runs](#commits-of-this-action-do-not-trigger-new-workflow-runs).
